`sprint` is implementation of `sprintf` function from C++. If it is ran in
Node.js envirnoment then it's used as module, otherwise module inserts
`sprint()` function into global object (usually `window`).

Usage:

```javascript
var sprint = require('sprint').sprint;
// Will return "b a"
console.log(sprint('%2$s %1$s', 'a', 'b'));
```

All standard format placeholders are supported with the exception of `%p`
(lack of pointers in JavaScript) and `%n` (lack of references in JavaScript).

In addition, following not standard features are supported:

* `n$` - number of the parameter allowing the parameters to be used multiple
  times or displayed in different order. It's not in C99, but it's POSIX
  entension, so support for it is already common.
* `%b` and `%B` - a binary number
* `%D`, `%U`, `%O` - practially their lowercase variants. Inserted in this
  list just because of their usage in Perl's `printf()` implementation.

For more information, read documentation of sprintf() in other programming
languages.
